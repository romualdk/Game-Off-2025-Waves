# Game Off 2025 Waves
Entry for Game Off 2025 WAVES

## 💡Idea

Defense of the colony on Mars. Similar to Doom VR shooters.

- Wave-based combat: Enemies spawn in waves and charge at the player.
- Stationary or limited movement: Many VR shooters use teleportation or restrict movement to avoid motion sickness.
