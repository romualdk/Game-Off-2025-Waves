Entry for Game Off 2025 **WAVES**

https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2025

## 🧠 Concept Summary

A lone elite soldier is deployed to Mars to secure a landing zone for future colonization. The player must defend a vital energy core from relentless waves of alien creatures.

Inspired by StarCraft's unit diversity, Doom's visceral combat, and Helldivers' tactical survival, this game blends fast-paced shooting with strategic defense.

## 📖 Story Overview

**Setting**

Year 2137. Humanity begins colonizing Mars. The first phase requires securing a location for the base's energy infrastructure. A lone Vanguard Trooper is dropped into hostile territory to protect the Energy Core until reinforcements arrive.

**Premise**

The Energy Core is the heart of the operation. It powers the trooper’s shockwave ability and will eventually power the colony. Alien lifeforms, disturbed by human presence, attack in waves. The trooper must survive long enough for the base to be established.

## 🕹️ Gameplay Mechanics
**♾️ Core Loop**
- Defend the Energy Core from waves of enemies.
- Use weapons and shockwave strategically.
- Survive until the final wave when reinforcements arrive.
